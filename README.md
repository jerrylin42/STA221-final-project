# Lights, Camera, Action! - Predicting Gross Revenue of Movies

by Team Rated R

## Summary

Movies have been at the heart of pop culture for nearly a century. And while movies have changed a lot over the years, varying in length, theme, due to technological advances, and more, one thing has never changedâ€“movies have remained as a dominant part of the entertainment industry. Through this project, we aimed to better understand what drives a movie's success or failure at the box office. From our analysis, the most influential factors were the average audience rating (vote), budget, runtime, release year, and whether the movie was categorized as having multiple genres. By focusing on factors like how well people like the movie, how much money is spent making it, and how many genres it covers, producers can make more informed decisions during production; at the same time, they should stay mindful of emerging trends in the entertainment industry, like streaming services, that continue to reshape what makes a movie successful.
